# Weaponizing-AI
Targeting system inspired from animal movement perception.<br>
**Status:** Not Complete - 27th July 2020
## Idea 
- Making a low computational-power perception logic for differentiating the enemy from the background. 
- Track the past moments of the enemies and save the enemy moments for higher efficiency.
- A two camera setup for a 3-axis vulnerable area tracking. (Head, neck, etc.)
